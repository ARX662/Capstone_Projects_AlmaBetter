        "- **Concentration:** The vast majority of values are concentrated between **3.0 and 5.0**, with peaks near the upper end of the scale. This suggests that most companies are rated relatively favorably.\n",
        "- **Outliers/Invalid Entries:** There is a noticeable small bar at **-1**, likely representing missing or flagged data for unrated companies. This aligns with Glassdoor’s convention of marking unrated/missing ratings as '-1'.\n",
        "- **Distribution Gap:** There are almost no ratings between **-1** and **2**, consistent with how user-driven rating systems rarely have companies rated extremely poorly (possibly due to platform moderation or self-selection bias)."

        "**Key Observations:**\n",
        "- **Central Tendency:** The majority of salaries cluster around the **$90,000–$110,000** range, as indicated by the tallest bars.\n",
        "- **Distribution Shape:** The distribution is roughly unimodal with a rightward skew; a small subset of higher salaries stretches the distribution’s tail to the right.\n",
        "- **Range and Spread:** The lowest average salaries are just below **$50,000**, while the maximum extends above **$200,000**, though only a handful of jobs reach these extremes.\n",
        "- **Outliers:** Very high salaries (above $180,000–$200,000) are rare and may represent senior-level or exceptional positions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Summary:**  \n",
        "This histogram conveys that **average salary** is approximately normally distributed but slightly right-skewed in your Glassdoor dataset. Modeling this as a regression problem is appropriate."

If this variable represents user age, the distribution implies most users fall within younger brackets (0–50 years), while only a small fraction are older. A gradual decline in frequency is observed as age increases, with very few users above 150 years—these could be outliers, data entry errors, or exceptional cases."

        "### Boxplot Chart Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "This chart displays boxplots for three variables—**age**, **average_salary**, and **Rating**. Each boxplot summarizes the central tendency, dispersion, and outliers for its respective variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Observations\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Age**\n",
        "  - The distribution is highly right-skewed, with most ages concentrated in the lower range.\n",
        "  - The median age is below the middle of the range, with a sizable interquartile range (IQR).\n",
        "  - Numerous outliers are present above the upper whisker, indicating a small group of users or companies with much higher ages than the rest. This could reflect outlier records or data entry errors and may warrant further inspection.\n",
        "- **Average Salary**\n",
        "  - The salary data also shows a right skew.\n",
        "  - The median is closer to the lower end, and a notable number of high-value outliers extend above the upper whisker, suggesting there are jobs or individuals with much higher salaries than the majority.\n",
        "  - The IQR and whiskers illustrate a substantial spread, indicating significant variability among offered or reported salaries.\n",
        "- **Rating**\n",
        "  - The ratings are tightly clustered, with the box and whiskers significantly narrower than the other variables.\n",
        "  - Outliers exist below and above, but the spread of typical values (within the box) is much smaller. This reflects the fact that most companies/jobs have ratings in a narrow band, while a few have unusually high or low values.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "This boxplot analysis highlights central trends, the extent of variability, and the prevalence of outliers for each key variable. These insights support informed decisions around data cleaning, preprocessing, and modeling strategy for Glassdoor salary predictions."

        "### Correlation Matrix Heatmap Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "This heatmap visualizes the correlation coefficients between key numerical features in the Glassdoor dataset: **age**, **average_salary**, **Rating**, **JDdesc_len**, and **Comp**.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Observations\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Diagonal Dominance:** Each feature has a perfect correlation with itself along the diagonal, indicated by the darkest green squares. This is expected and serves as a reference for the scale.\n",
        "- **Strength of Relationships:** Correlation values range from 0 (no correlation) to approximately 0.3 (weak positive correlation). There are no strong linear relationships (>0.5 or <-0.5) between the variables, indicating that each feature captures different aspects of the data.\n",
        "- **Notable Feature Pairs:**\n",
        "  - **age vs. JDdesc_len / Comp:** Slight positive correlations are observed between age and both job description length and number of competitors. This suggests that older entities may have longer job descriptions and list more competitors, though the relationship is weak.\n",
        "  - **average_salary Relationships:** The average_salary feature shows low correlation with other variables, implying that salary is influenced by multiple factors not strongly captured by these individual features alone.\n",
        "  - **Comp vs. age, average_salary, Rating:** The number of competitors (Comp) shows modest positive correlation with age and average_salary, suggesting older or higher-paying entities might mention more competitors.\n",
        "- **Low/No Correlation:** The lightest squares (almost white) reveal near-zero correlation, indicating independence between some feature pairs. For example, Rating and JDdesc_len are nearly uncorrelated.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "This heatmap reveals that core features like age, salary, rating, job description length, and competitors exhibit generally weak pairwise correlations. This supports their simultaneous use in multivariate modeling and motivates further exploration for more powerful predictive relationships."

        "### Categorical Feature Bar Plots Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "The provided bar charts each visualize the top 20 most frequent categories for three categorical variables from the Glassdoor dataset: **Location**, **Headquarters**, and **company_text** (company name, cleaned).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Top 20 Location\n",
        "- The chart reveals that roles are heavily concentrated in major urban hubs such as New York, NY; San Francisco, CA; Cambridge, MA; and Chicago, IL.\n",
        "- The frequency of job postings declines steeply beyond the leading cities, reflecting the dominance of industry hotspots within the dataset.\n",
        "- This pattern suggests the need to treat location as a highly influential feature in salary modeling, and possibly to consolidate less frequent locations into an “Other” category to reduce sparsity.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Top 20 Headquarters\n",
        "- Similarly, the chart for headquarters confirms that company headquarters are also clustered in large cities, with New York, NY and San Francisco, CA leading.\n",
        "- There is greater diversity as the list progresses, including international (e.g., Osaka, Japan) and less populous cities.\n",
        "- Recognizing headquarters concentration supports the analysis of corporate influence and regional factors on salary levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Top 20 Company Names\n",
        "- This bar plot highlights that, within the dataset, firms such as MassMutual, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, and Reynolds American are among the most represented.\n",
        "- The recurrence of certain company names may correspond to hiring campaigns or greater industry presence.\n",
        "- High-frequency companies may disproportionately influence overall salary patterns, warranting adjustments for company-specific effects in modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "These visualizations are central to understanding categorical feature distributions, identifying industry or location concentration effects, and informing robust feature engineering in the salary prediction workflow."
